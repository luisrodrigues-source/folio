                          <h3>The POC (1st phase)</h3>
                            <p>Create a POC for the bank Design System assuring all the benefits will be understood. Get the full support of all the stakeholders to invest in the full implementation of the DS.</p>

                          <p>Design operations consultor responsible for the structure and design specs for the implementation of the bank Design System, working closely with all the stakeholders, but in specially with the developers and designers to establish a functional workflow system.</p><p>
                        
                              In this first phase, I was the team leader of the Axians' Squad  (1 Designer and 3 developers) as a consultor and according to my experience, <strong>I should suggest and define with the bank team the best practices to follow in order to implement the Design system structure and to create and share the technical design guidelines to the Devs assuring the correct implementation of the components.</strong> 
                             </p>
                             <p>
                             Working in an Agile inveronment, the communication between all the stakeholders involved in this process should be a priority, with particular focus on the improvement of the workflow between designers and developers. Based on this objective I participated in many evangelistic sessions about the advantages for the bank to have a Design system, and, on how to start exploring and use the DS with the components that we were building.
                            <br>

                             <h4 class="intro">The multibrand challenge</h4>

<p>One of the most interesting and challenging parts of this project was the multi-brand goal. <strong>The design system should be prepared for different brand themes,</strong> meaning that the same base component should adapt to different UI schemes defined by distinct brands. In this case two banks of the same group, Millennium bcp and Activo bank. <strong>Here my mission was again to facilitate this alignment, with focus on the technical issues to adopt so we could achieve this purpose.</strong></p>

                          <p>On the first phase the objective was to create a POC of what should be the Millennium Design System. This project initially was based on the existing App, and the scope considered the main areas of this solution which should be decomposed in sharable components, instantiated in React Native with the quality standards determined by the bank, and stored in a common library repository(Storybook) linked to the design specs. </p>

                            <p>We started by making an Inventory of all the existent components and graphical guidelines on the actual App. 

The inventory was based on the existing Millennium App. So in coordination with the design team, we started by analysing the source design files made in Sketch where they use to have defined their components.

To have a complete overall of all elements, these processe documented all the existing assets, with special attention for the defined export format specs in sketch,the generated nomenclature and the defined folder structure for export.

These graphical assets were also exported in SVG format. The objective was to have an SVG version available for implementation on the online version doc of the inventory. To make this option available the online version of the inventory was made in Adobe XD. The advantage of this methodology was to improve the workflow with the developers team in charge of creating the new modular components in React Native. While the inventory was made and all the graphical assets were reviewed, the respective technical specs for implementation were available based on regular updates.</p>
                            
<h4 class="intro">Atomic Design system</h4>
<p>With the inventory made it was time to the analysis of all components and the respective restructure of the Design System based on Atomic Design System.</p>
<h4 class="intro">Modular</h4>
<p>Provide the necessary design and technical specifications to the correct implementation of a modular system following the best practices.</p>

<p>By following the Atomic design process we start by restructuring all the existing graphical elements into groups of Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms.</p>
<p>
Atoms are the smallest indivisible components of all, the original concept basically categorizes the components accordingly with their complexity being atoms the simplest and organisms the more complex ones, for instance, we can consider atoms - buttons, icons, input fields, checkboxes, etc… but it also defines text styles and colors as atoms, and in this point, <strong>we thougth these styles should be separated from atoms into a new element that could group this kind of patterns.</strong></p>

<h4 class="intro">Electrons</h4>
<p>
With the need to separate these perceptual patterns from atoms, <strong>we felt the necessity to create a new element for styles.</strong> Since the atoms are the smallest, and to follow the main concept, the electron element seemed to be the best choice.</p>
<p>
By looking at the electron function we realised that like styles they are responsible for defining the characteristics of molecules and by sequence the organisms as well. The electrons in the last orbit like the valence ones, are shared between atoms, and these analogy matched perfectly since like color and text styles, these are all commonly shared elements.

So in terms of structure based on Atomic Design System, Millennium will have their own version organised like this.</p>

                            <h3>Design Tokens</h3>
<p>
As referred before with the need to separe perceptual patterns from atoms, we felt the necessity to create a new element for styles. Since the atoms are the smallest, and to follow the main concept, the electron element seemed to be the best choice.

To turn the Design System more scalable, consistent and adaptable to different themes, we use tokens. These are used for colours, typography styles, spacing definitions and other design decisions. 
<strong>So our tokens are as well the electrons our subatomic particles.</strong></p>
                            </div>
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            <h4 class="intro">Design Tokens Definition</h4>
<p>
Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system - spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. - represented as data.

These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences. In resume tokens in this context are the design variables</p>
                            </div>
                        <div class="col-md-12">
                            <h4 class="intro">Tokens and the possibility of having different themes</h4>
<p>
In the case of color usage, for a different theme, the same token can be mapped to a different hex value. Tokens not only allow for more efficient color updates within a theme, but also enable any UI (or portion of a UI) to switch between different themes.</p>
<p>
A single token can be associated with multiple roles, but only if the color value is used consistently across those roles. This allows for uniform color application across themes while maintaining full styling flexibility.
                            </p><p>
With this system it will be possible to create different themes by assigning new values to the established color tokens.</p>
<p>
There are several approaches to the use of Design Tokens, in this case we are following one with a simple hierarchal model.
                            </p><p>
As referred, design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system represented as data.

Tokens can represent anything defined by design, they’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.</p><p>

<strong>These specs follow a model of 3 types of design tokens</strong></p>

                            <ul class"about-list"><h4 class="intro">Global tokens</h4>
                               
                                <li>Global tokens are the global values in our design language, they should be represented by context-agnostic names. Global tokens can also be used as values for Alias Tokens and Component Tokens, they are at the bottom level of the token hierarchy.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul class"about-list"><h4>Alias tokens</h4>
                               
                                <li>Alias Tokens describe with an alias a group characterized by a common pattern. These types of tokens are related to a specific context or abstraction, their function is to communicate a purpose.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul class"about-list"><h4 >Component tokens</h4>
                               
                                <li>Component tokens describe properties of a component, like button-color-primary-default-background, which describes the background color of a primary button in its default state.</li>
                            </ul>

<h4 class="intro">Naming convention</h4>
<p>
In terms of naming convention, the logic is to follow a hierarchy level based on different combinations of attributeTypes, attributes, and attributeVariants. The attributeType designation is mostly based on common CSS properties, e.g. color, font-size, etc. For the “Alias” the convention is to use a short and understandable word, e.g. background, title, etc.</p>

<h4 class="intro">Tokens the solution for a multibrand system</h4>
<p>So as referred above one of the most interesting and challenging parts of the scope of this project was the multi-brand goal. The design system should be prepared for different brand themes, meaning that the same base component should adapt to different UI schemes defined by distinct brands.</p><p>To make it possible each of the brands should be aligned using the same tokens. To accomplish this, <strong>the token nomenclature was one of the most important issues, and here my function was to facilitate this process by gettering the stakeholders from both banks at the same table, especially the Design teams and the Developers, align the token sematic and assure it will be reflected in the base libraries on Figma so this change could be effectively seen in the inspect mode (Figma.</strong> By doing this, the developers could understand each token to use when they are analyzing the project layouts made by the designers, of course, in terms of development the tokens were as well mapped following the same semantic principles.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There is still a lot to share about this project, this is simply a resume with some highlights of a very challenging project in which I have participated, with great professionals that keep this System alive. <strong>In terms of resume, on the last presentation made by our team, the Design System was composed by 9 Figma libraries with around 1.8k components and variants, being used by 18 teams in support for more than 75 different projects.</strong></p>
